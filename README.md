The goal of the CS412-Machine Learning project is to gain hands-on experience on the ML project pipeline. In this project, you will have the opportunity to apply several classification algorithms to the real-world problem of credit risk assessment using the widely used benchmark: German Credit (Statlog) Dataset. You will gain practical experience in selecting and evaluating classification algorithms and determining the most important features for predicting credit risk.





Dataset
The German Credit (Statlog) Dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for credit risk assessment. It contains 1, 000 instances, each represented by 9 features such as age, sex, credit history, and job stability. The dataset includes 700 instances labeled as ”good credit” and 300 instances labeled as ”bad credit”. The goal is to predict whether a given loan applicant is likely to have good or bad credit based on the available features.





Methodology
Here is a list of the classification algorithms that you can apply to the problem (you should choose at least 3 that you deem suitable for the project):
• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
• Decision Trees (DT)
• Logistic Regression (LR)
• Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)
• Support Vector Machines (SVM)
